# Notes
- HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD, CONNECT, TRACE
- get retrieves data
- post submits data
- put updates data
- delete deletes data
- so far this is all we have used
- make sure you can handle exceptions when creating an application, unless you would like your application to crash
- make methods in service class and then call them in controller
- many to many is a relationship between two entities where many instances of an entity can be associated with many instances of another entity
- one to many is a relationship between two entities where one instance of an entity can be associated with many instances of another entity
- on to one is a relationship between two entities where one instance of an entity can only be associated with one instance of the other entity
- response header is sent by server to client and provides additional information about response, for example content-type header would specify the type of content that the server is sending
- uri is to identify resources that can be accessed over a network, it requires a scheme(http://) and a path(/{id})
- in computeresultcontroller: you cannot use .equals as == compares the memory location/object instance/reference equality check and .equals() checks the content/value of whatever is being tested and checks for equality
